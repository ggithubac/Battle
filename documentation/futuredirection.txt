How this Battle can be further enhanced, few other things I thought how this problem can be made more interesting:

Give more capability to the Chief of the army i.e give him a horse.
Add Tankers and Artillery to the battle field
Add AirForce Capabilities
Add Navy Capabilities
Declare victory only when all forms of the battle, on the ground, airforce and navy are won
Add graphical interface and convert this to a real simulation --> This will be a huge task I believe there are huge gaming companies working and have commercial products in the market place.
